LynxPHP aims to be the Wordpress of imageboards that's easily installable on shared hosting
with the features of LynxChan. While designed for small communities it can be used for larger ones.

Goals
- 2-3 distinct pieces
- all similar functionality grouped into modules
- Works on shared hosting and is easy to install as any PHP/MySQL web app
- Raw php/js, in hopes to require less frameworks to learn
- documentation before code
- aim for the lynxchan feature set
- backend REST API that mobile clients can talk to directly
- try to make the styling and maintainence of features easy
- try to make adding new features easy

We'll focus on the backend Layer first
